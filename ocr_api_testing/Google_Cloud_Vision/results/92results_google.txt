FROM BOMBAY WITH LOVE
THE OLD IRANI CAFÉS HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED. Their faded
elegance welcomed all: courting couples, taxi-wallas, students, artists and lawyers.
These cafés broke down barriers by bringing people together over food and drink.
Bombay was more open and welcoming for their existence. Dishoom pays homage to the
Irani cafés and the food of all Bombay.

ballrooms. With the help of our friend Naresh Fernandes - whose book Taj Mahal Foxtrot
tells the story of Bombay in swing time this café (and our one-off immersive theatrical
production Night at the Bombay Rory) remembers that golden age of Bombay jazz
